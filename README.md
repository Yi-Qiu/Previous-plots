Note that: some plots may have confusing labels/legends compared to the current versions, but since i haven't correctly save the data the time they are made, some explanations will be added while the extra corrections may not be able to be done.

#### Absolute difference between the real part of numerical relativity data from Daniel and fitting models have different reference time $t_r$.

Note that the $t_0$ here in the legends actually denotes the $t_r$, which is the reference time in the wave solution formula.

#### Bestfit $\alpha_0/\beta_0$ values with respect to the time evolution in models with $N_{max}=[0,4]$.

The point of these plot were the error region computed. While these plots are done with only the real part of data, the Nonlinearmodelfit is applicable here, and thus the errors can be obtained easily.

#### Results of the absolute difference between the recovered mass/spin from fitting model and true values.

These were plotted at times when we want to find an alternative way to obtain mass/spin from qnm. <u>While the idea to separete the values of mass/spin bias maybe interest to look into for now as we tend to always consider them only jointly.</u>

#### Lowest epsilon's and mismatch's $\alpha_n/\beta_n$ values in the highest tone perturbed models

The "epi" in the plot was a typo, i was trying to refer to the epsilon $\epsilon$. :) This plot basically just shows the difference of lowest point positions in the grids searching for either lowest mismatch or lowest epsilon.

#### Lowest mismatch's $\alpha_0/\beta_0$ values evolution with tone numbers.

The plot was done with the BBH:0305 data. The alpha0/beta0 presented are all taken absolute values of the them. The $\alpha_0/\beta_0$ have overall decaying trends.

#### Epsilons on the 1-direction modification to the highest tone perturbed models.

The reference blue lines indicate the values of epsilon calculated with the original overtone models have n-1 tones. This was done when the 2D plot idea had not yet come out. (note that the legends pp, pm... denotes the plus-plus, plus-minus, etc. on the $\alpha_n/\beta_n$ values respectively).
